4. Update projects in `src/components/Projects.tsx`

### Styling

The website uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the theme by modifying:

- Colors: Update the color scheme in `tailwind.config.js`
- Typography: Modify font settings in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Spacing: Adjust padding and margins in component files

### Adding Projects

To add a new project, update the `projects` array in `src/components/Projects.tsx`:

```typescript
const projects: Project[] = [
  {
    title: 'Your Project',
    description: 'Project description',
    technologies: ['Tech1', 'Tech2'],
    githubUrl: 'https://github.com/yourusername/project',
    liveUrl: 'https://project.example.com',
    image: '/project-image.jpg',
  },
  // Add more projects...
];
```

### Contact Form

The contact form is set up to handle submissions, but you'll need to add your own form handling logic in `src/components/Contact.tsx`. You can integrate it with services like:

- Email service (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Form backends (Formspree, Netlify Forms)
- Custom API endpoint
